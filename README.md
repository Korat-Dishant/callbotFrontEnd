# Note : 
currently we have hosted our entire system on the free tiers of varios service providers because of which you might face increased time delay.
We are using services like zillizcloud, render and vercel. some of which have policies to spin off containers of unsubscribed users after some time. So even after some time of inactivity it would require to redeploy container which may take some time. contact me at koratdishant536631@gmail.com if you face any issues.
